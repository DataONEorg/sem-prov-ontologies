# Semantics and Provenance Ontologies

Community developed and maintained ontologies for concepts needed for earth observations data and workflow processes. The repositorry contains the following ontologies:

* ProvONE: Workflow provenance model extending W3C PROV
* ECSO: The Ecosystems Ontology
* SALMO: Salmon Concepts Ontology
* Arctic Report Card: Concepts for the NOAA Arctic Report Card
* MOSAIC: An ontology for annotating data from the MOSAiC Expedition

These were originally developed by the Semantics and Provenance Working Group from [DataONE](https://dataone.org), but now are open for community contributions and maintenance.

This repository stores proposed and in-development ontologies focused on scientific observations and scientific workflow provenance.  Ontologies are namespaced and versioned.
