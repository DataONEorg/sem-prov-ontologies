This dir contains info about strings searched in the LTER data catalog.

*lis
2 files with an ~8-year record of every search string that has been entered into the LTER data search interface by catalog users (one from each of 2 interfaces). It's simple database output, with 2 columns: "string", "count". There was no processing applied. Credit for collecting this info goes to Duane Costa and Mark Servilla.


*txt
SQL queries producing the output.

We (the ontology builders) will want to examine this for terms that we probably should incorporate in the NPP ontology (exactly how is TBD). Since this is what our users have actually asked for, it's insight into their minds. We will need to reduce it to something manageable and extract the NPP-relevant parts, so we will probably need help from one of the language processing experts
