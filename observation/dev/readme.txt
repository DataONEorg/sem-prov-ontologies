ontofox_input_ENVO.txt now includes contiunant and occurrent. these are the best settings so far. 
1. There are fewer bare classes, but the trees will probably need some pruning
2. still does not pass reasoner (hermit)

not yet able to recreate the ENVO import that was created earlier. 
working files are stashed here

current problems:
1. don't really know the settings used by students (sophie, chase) in earlier versions.
See file ontofox_input_ENVO for my best guess, using their notes, and eolson's experience

2. using that best guess, some new classes added to ENVO fail the reasoner when imported to ECSO 
particularly the glacier tree, and processes. both under Entity.

3. continuant not appearing.

4. some chemical_entities (eg, carbon) were imported earlier with CHEBI, but are incomplete now.
 
5. too many bare classes to handle well or easily.
