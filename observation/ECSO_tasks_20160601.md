ECSO Improvements, 2016

Goal:  Organize the work on ECSO, and develop a plan for next phase
   evaluation run 
 - When is the next P/R run?  *TBD, when tasks have time estimate*.
 - What changes on the ontology need to be done by then? *BELOW, responsible party in * **BOLD** 
 - What changes on the algorithm need to be done by then? **TBD - **Jim****

ECSO tasks
--------------

1. Problems exposed by reasoner are resolved
	1. OBOE rule on DerivedUnit 
		1. hasUnit exactly 1 (BaseUnit or PrefixedUnit) 
		2.	Short term fix: remove this rule because we are not performing conversions **BEN**
		3. Long term: repair, need expert advice **JIM**
	2. object properties on Primary Production Carbon Flux and Fixed Carbon Pool, eg RO_0001000 (derives from) 
		1. Described: see notes, doc titled “ECSO History, Notes”
		2. Short term fix: remove rules on these two classes **MARGARET**
		3. Long Term fix: we will want these rules corrected for searches. need expert advice: **JIM**
2. Autogenerated classes: for carbon-flux related classes, adapt or adopt Entity, MeasurementType, Characteristic into main ontology. 
	1. Add minimum acceptable annotation (rdfs:label, definition, definition_Source, Definition_Contributor (an orcid). Other desirable annots: example_Of_Usage **MARGARET, STUDENT**
	1. Subclassing: move to appropriate trees **MARGARET, MARK**
3. Existing carbon-cycling related classes
	1. Add or subclass per notes **MARGARET, MARK**
4. MsTMIP classes
	1. Confirm that all Sophie’s new info has been incorporated **STUDENT**
5. PATO qualities - OBOE characteristics
	1. equate where appropriate **JIM, MARGARET**
6. Synonyms/alternate labels
	1. file of suggested (by wikipedia) synonyms **JIM**
	2. Confirm and incorporate **BRYCE**
