###DataONE SEM Group - Test Corpora Design 
 
###Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the objectives and to provide the description of the procedure used for defining datasets that will be used as test corpora for DataONE SEM group’s carbon cycle ontology project.  The document also summarizes the test corpora in the “Results” section.  
 
###Background
DataONE SEM group is currently developing an ontology to model the knowledge in the area of primary production.  The ontology is intended to improve the understandability and the discoverability of DataONE datasets.  In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the ontology, the datasets will be annotated with classes from the ontology, both automatically (with term-matching algorithms) and manually (with expert user input) **(ref Ben’s annotation plan here)**.  Queries will be applied to the a test corpus both without and with the annotations.  The results from the queries will be reviewed to determine the effectiveness of the ontology through the metrics of recall (see footnote 1) and precision (see footnote 2).  As a result, in order to evaluate the impact of ontology, test corpora need to be established.
 
###Objectives
- Establish various test corpora in order to allow the DataONE SEM group to evaluate the carbon cycle ontology systematically.

###Methodology/Process
1) Determine the requirements for the baseline corpus.

>a) Based on the definitions of recall and precision, it is necessary to know for certain both the numbers of datasets that will be relevant and those that will NOT be relevant to the query submitted.  This information will enable the calculation of the values for recall and precision of each query.

>b) The number for each types of datasets (relevant and irrelevant) cannot be too “small”, so that the query result becomes trivial.

>c) It is preferable that the test corpus contains real datasets from the current DataONE database and not “mark-up” or made-up datasets.

2) Based on the requirements for the baseline test corpus, define the datasets that can be used for a specific test corpus.

###Results
As a result of considering the requirements for the baseline corpus, the DataONE SEM group defined different test corpora summarized in the following table.  Each successive test corpus adds an additional, specific set of datasets to the previous test corpus, so that the size of the test corpus is increased systematically.
