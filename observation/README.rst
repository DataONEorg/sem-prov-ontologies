This directory stores ontologies related to scientific observations.

This is meant to be a collaborative space as we develop ontologies that meet
the annotation goals in phase 2 of the DataONE project.

Candidate ontologies include:
* OBOE extensions that include Entities, Measurements, Characteristics, Standards, and Protocols. E.g.,
	* OBOE: http://ecoinformatics.org/oboe/oboe.1.0/oboe.owl
	* OBOE-SBC: http://ecoinformatics.org/oboe-ext/sbclter.1.0/oboe-sbclter.owl
* O&M lite models
* Other domain-relevant ontologies
	* SWEET and others?
